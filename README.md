# JavaScript-Password-Generator
A password generator with user-defined length and character-type parameters

## What I did: 

1. Created repo and readme
2. Created arrays for each password criteria
3. Created function to capture password length via window prompts
4. Created functions to let user tell me Y/N if they want each PW criteria, and for each criteria selected changes the corresponding value in the object promptValues to "True"
5. Created methods for the promptValues object that check for T/F for each criteria and for every true found add the corresponding array to a superarray.
6. Added a random number generator
7. Created a function that uses random numbers to pick out positions in the superarray and write the corresponding characters to the variable 'password'



## To Do: 

1. Figure out how to make sure at least one of each selected criteria makes it into the password.

## Criteria:

### Style:

1. clean and polished
2. responsive

### Functionality:

1. Push button to open prompt
2. Prompt asks for pw criteria
3. length: 8-128 characters
4. character type: lower, upper, numeric, special
5. validate input, always make sure one is selected
6. generate password
7. display password in alert or write it to the page
